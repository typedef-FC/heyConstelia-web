# heyConstelia-web

Conversion of the `heyConstelia.lua` GUI to web content. This repository is used by `heyConstelia.lua` to retrieve the latest web content per launch.

Style is bland and contains nothing outside the mandatory necessities. Feel free to submit style changes on the [Hey Constelia! (AI)](https://constelia.ai/forums/index.php?threads/hey-constelia-ai.9299/). You can turn off `heyConstelia.lua.auto_update` to prevent the script from overwriting your style.

The source code for `heyConstelia.lua` is found [on the source page](https://constelia.ai/members/source.php?id=230).
